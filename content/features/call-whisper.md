Effortlessly manage your business and personal life on one phone with eLandline's Call Whisper. This clever tool briefs you about incoming calls, ensuring you're always prepared.

### How It Works

Call Whisper offers two modes to fit your needs:

1. **Immediate Connection**: Hear a short Whisper message followed by a beep, and the call connects automatically.
2. **Call Screening Option**: The Whisper message plays, giving you the choice to either accept the call by pressing '1' or to skip it. Ignored calls move on to the next designated number or go to voicemail if no alternatives are set.

### The Perks of Call Whisper

- **Screen Your Calls**: With the press-to-accept feature, Call Whisper doubles as a call screening tool, empowering you to decide on the fly whether to engage or not.
- **For Your Ears Only**: The Whisper is audible only to you. Callers hear standard ringing, ensuring a professional experience.
- **Affordable Peace of Mind**: Available at just Â£3.31 +VAT per month for each number. Add it during the ordering process or through customer service for existing numbers.

### Practical Uses

- **Business vs. Personal**: Know it's a business call on your dual-purpose mobile, allowing you to respond with the appropriate greeting.
- **Location-Specific Calls**: Identify calls from different area codes, perfect for targeted local advertising.
- **Multiple Businesses, One Phone**: Determine which business the call is for, so you can answer accordingly.
- **Track Your Ads**: Find out which advertisement prompted the call, like "Nottingham Yellow Pages Advert", optimising your marketing efforts.

### Enhancing Your Call Experience

Call Whisper, or Call Screening, enriches your call management by:

- **Custom Messages**: Tailor the Whisper for each call based on the dialled number, providing specific insights before you answer.
- **Professionalism Boost**: Answer calls more knowledgeably, whether for business, customer support, or sales.
- **Marketing Insights**: Gauge the success of different campaigns with unique messages for each non-geographic number.
- **Multi-Business Management**: Run several businesses from one line confidently, always knowing how to answer.

Whether working from home or juggling multiple roles, Call Whisper keeps you informed and in control.
